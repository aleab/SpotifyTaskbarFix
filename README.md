# SpotifyTaskbarFix
Fixes the much-hated, and never actually acknowledged nor fixed, issue with Spotify's taskbar icon appearing on the wrong monitor in a multi-monitor configuration on Windows. :pray:

The main thread on Spotify's community forum is [here](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Windows/Spotify-s-taskbar-icon-on-the-wrong-monitor-every-single-time/td-p/4669359).

**Q**: How the hell do I use this?  
**A**: Just compile it, run the program at system startup and forget about it.
